It was very helpful to give feedback to people because it got me thinking what I ought to add to my own blog. Whether it was adding extra charts or details, it was good to think about what 
should go in a blogpost from the actual perspective of a reader. As can be gleaned from the feedback in this folder, sometimes people are not as eager to give helpful criticism, but I'm 
willing to do that for others, thus I can take that and use it myself.  It was helpful to get feedback on the dashboard because I cannot always think about what kind of graphs would be 
interesting to look at. With this data especially where there is little numerical data, it was good to hear what others had to say.
