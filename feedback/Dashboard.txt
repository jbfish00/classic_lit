The information on the blogs is super interesting.  I like how you use the charts and graphs to visually show the counties that have the “greatest hits”.   


Okay, on the dashboard how are the authors categorized?  Because it's hard to know which authors are listed when you are choosing.  Can you alphabetize them?  Other than that it's pretty awesome!


I love the dashboard.  That is super cool how it is interactive.  There is a lot of information there to play around with.

Here is one suggestion for an additional graph.  It would be interesting to have a graph divided into time periods and see how many books are from different countries in those time periods.
