The articles were very interesting as well... very easy to read and understand.  Although I am shocked that you had never heard of John Grisham.  But maybe you are just too young... several books of his were made into movies when I was in middle and high school.  I've actually only read one of his books though--Christmas with the Kranks (have you never seen the movie, with Tim Allen?)

That was a  lot of work to organize all that information.  It is concise and easy to read. I was glad to discover that I have read many of the top rated books
